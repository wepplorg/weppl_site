   <h5><b>24. Applicable Law & Jurisdiction</b></h5>

Weppl welcomes Foreign Donors / Contributors to participate in campaigns by making donations and contributions which shall be subject to the existing Indian laws. Those who choose to access this site from other locations/Countries other than India do so on the understanding that all transactions are bipartite in nature between the Campaigner and the Donor / Contributor. Weppl shall not be held liable for any dispute between the two parties. For any disputes involving Weppl whether as a formal party or otherwise, the jurisdiction shall exclusively be with the courts in Raipur, India.</p>
   <h5><b>25. Dispute Resolution</b></h5>
   <p>(i) Any dispute involving Weppl, whether as a formal party or otherwise shall be resolved by Arbitration of a sole Arbitrator appointed by Weppl and in accordance with the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The seat of Arbitration shall be in Raipur and the language to be used in all proceedings shall be English.</p>
   <p>(ii) Weppl and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>
         claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;
      </li>

      <li>claims that may arise after the termination of this Terms of Service.</li>
   </ul>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into this Terms of Service, you and Weppl are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Terms of Service.</p>
   <h5><b>26. Limitation of Liability</b></h5>
   <p>(i) In no event shall Weppl be liable for any incidental, indirect or consequential damages of any kind in connection with theses terms of use.</p>
   <p>YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT NEITHER Weppl NOR ITS AFFILIATES WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF Weppl HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, RESULTING FROM: (I) THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE; (II) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES RESULTING FROM ANY GOODS, DATA, INFORMATION OR SERVICES PURCHASED OR OBTAINED OR MESSAGES RECEIVED OR TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO THROUGH OR FROM THE SERVICE; (III) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA; (IV) STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICE; OR (V) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE SERVICE. IN NO EVENT WILL Weppl's TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES OR CAUSES OF ACTION EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID Weppl IN THE LAST SIX (6) MONTHS, OR, IF GREATER, Two Thousand Indian Rupees (Rs. 2000).</p>
   <p>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE OR WITH THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USE OF THE SERVICE.</p>
   <p>Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration: PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS</p>
   <p>Most user concerns can be resolved quickly and to the user's satisfaction by emailing Weppl support at admin@Weppl.org In the unlikely event that our user support team is unable to resolve a complaint you may have (or if Weppl has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration, mediation, or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration, which is often cheaper, faster and less formal than a lawsuit in court, uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Also, in any arbitration under this arbitration provision in which you seek less than Rs. 200,000 in damages, Weppl will pay reasonable attorneys' fees should you prevail. Weppl will not seek attorneys' fees from you. However, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than Rs. 200,000 in damages, the payment of attorneys' fees will be governed by the applicable rules (as defined below). Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.</p>
   <h5><b>27. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policy</b></h5>
   <p>We comply with the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) guidelines established by the Reserve Bank of India, vide it's circular RPCD.RRB.RCB.AML.BC.No.02/07.51.018/2014-15 on 1 July, 2014 and updated from time to time.

   <ol>
      <li>
         <p>Every recipient (campaign organisers on Weppl) has to verify her identity per the Know Your Customer (KYC) in the guidelines.

Permanent Account Number, Aadhar Card Number, Passport etc. recognised by the Reserve Bank of India. The list of such registered documents will be updated on Weppl.org site, at its sole discretion, from time to time.</p>
      </li>
      <p>The verification will be essential to withdraw funds from Weppl, and may be asked by Weppl, at its sole discretion, during the course of a campaign. Failure to comply, may result in cancellation of a fundraising campaign, and funds may be returned to donors in such a scenario.</p>
      <p>Your location as reflected on your Campaign page must match your legal residence that you submit to Weppl when you create a withdrawal request. Campaign Owners may not create multiple Campaigns without proof of meeting fulfillment obligations from the original Campaign. Failure to adequately fulfill Campaign obligations may result in Weppl removing the Campaign(s) and seeking reimbursement of Campaign funds raised, including by using third-party collections services. Only the Campaign Owner shall be permitted to collect Campaign funds.</p>
      <p>Campaign Owners are responsible for collecting and remitting any taxes on Contributions, and any taxes due in connection with Campaign Owners may not use a false email address to self-fund, or contribute to, their own Campaigns; this is a violation of Stripe policies and of our Terms of Use.</p>
      <p>Weppl may attempt to verify the identity and other information provided to us by Campaign Owners, and we may delay, withhold, reverse or refund any Contributions or other amounts without notice or liability in the event we are unable to verify any such information to our satisfaction. Campaign Owner eligibility is subject to Weppl’s review of the fulfillment status of prior crowdfunding obligations.</p>
      <p>Taxing authorities may classify funds raised on the Services as taxable income to the Campaign Owner and any beneficiary who will receive funds directly from the applicable Campaign. Weppl will ask for the personal account number / tax identification number (PAN) of Campaign Owners and any beneficiaries so that we may report taxable income to the relevant taxing authorities.</p>
      <li>
         <p>For contributors on Weppl.org, only standard channels of payment - verified credit or debit cards, netbanking, cheque, or cash (upto limits allowed by the RBI) - will be allowed. In case of cash payments, all payments above INR 24,999 have to be furnished with the Permanent Account Number of the contributor.</p>
      </li>
      <p><b>Recipients (campaign organisers, whether individuals or organizations) will comply with foreign exchange rules</b> as explained by the Foreign Exchange Management Act of the RBI & FCRA guidelines. The recipient if an individual or an non-government organization also understands that it needs to comply with FCRA guidelines by applying for an FCRA certificate and inform the Central Government in Form FC-1 within thirty days from the date of receipt of such contribution whenever applicable. This form is available on the website</p>
      <p>The recipients acknowledge and agree that Weppl does not verify this information and it’s the responsibility of the recipient to procure the necessary approvals and do the necessary compliance before they withdraw the foreign funds received for the campaign. By asking to withdraw the foreign funds its understood by Weppl that the recipient has completed the necessary documentation.</p>

         <p>AML policies will be updated time to time at the sole discretion of Weppl.</p>
      </li>
   </ol>
